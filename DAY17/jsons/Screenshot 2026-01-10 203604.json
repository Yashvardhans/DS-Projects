        "detailed_description": "A grayscale diagram illustrates a finite state machine with three states: A, B, and C. State A is designated as the initial state, and C is marked as the accepting state, with transitions between them labeled by binary inputs '0' and '1'. The diagram clearly depicts directed edges, self-loops, and the flow of computation based on these inputs.",
