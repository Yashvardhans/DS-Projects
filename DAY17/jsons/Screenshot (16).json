I get along well with colleagues and others. For a project, after discussions with the team, once the exact tasks for individuals have been assigned, I like to fully concentrate and do my part alone. Naturally, keeping in touch with the team members to ensure that my part fits in well with their parts. I make sure that there is no communication gap. Finally, it is teamwork that makes a project successful.\nAnswer 2 (for 100% score)\nI prefer to work as a team member, because I believe that the best ideas are developed in partnership with others. I'm equally comfortable being a team member and a team lead\u2014a few months ago I was the lead of our college final project team where I encouraged not only the ideation but the distribution of tasks. Because of our great teamwork, we were able to produce our deliverables to the department before the deadline. I have also participated in college and school basketball teams. This has really helped me in my professional life, since I know how to evaluate the individual strengths of my associates, communicate well with them, and coordinate my efforts to support theirs.\nAnswer 3 (for 100% score)\nI can honestly say that I'm comfortable both in working independently as well as in contributing to teams, and student life teaches us both. Especially at the beginning of projects, I appreciate being able to strategize approaches with team members. Once we have our plan of action established, though, I enjoy working independently on my assigned tasks. We also do individual and group studies where we divide topics to learn and each team member takes the responsibility to learn and explain the topic to others. I was particularly fond of ensuring my team members learnt the topics by searching online and asking relevant questions.\nAnswer 4 (for 100% score)\nWhile I'm happy being a strong team player, I also love being able to take the lead and coordinate everyone's efforts. I have great organizational, scheduling, and follow-up skills, which is why my class teacher and friends often call upon me to take the lead in important class and other projects, such as conducting a class event, organizing groups in class, motivating students for helpful activities etc. Even in school I was a class monitor. I also believe that without good\nYB\nBhopal (VT)\n68\u00b0F\nHaze\nSearch\nENG\nIN\n10:46 PM\n11/16/2022",
