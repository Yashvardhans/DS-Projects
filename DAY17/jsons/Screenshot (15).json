It was very difficult and challenging. I had to plan, get approvals of the administrators and authorities, raise funds, motivate the volunteers and delegate tasks to them, supervise their work. It was like project management. I learned a lot from this experience, but finally the event was a great success. I wrote a report and several articles on it and published them. We formed an NGO and continue to give free tutoring to street children. That is my biggest achievement and I am proud of it., Answer 2 (for 100% score), Well, as a graduate student, I think my greatest achievement was what I managed to accomplish during my time in college. My scholarship only covered half of the tuition, and my family was unable to support me financially. I also wanted to gain some work experience during my time there, so that I could start working directly after graduating. I learned early on that I had to manage my time down to the hour in order to be efficient and on top of everything. Through hard work and dedication, I managed to balance studying, working part-time, and even volunteering to gain some experience. It was tiring at times, but I scheduled pretty much everything I had to do in my personal calendar. I needed to know my list of tasks, when each was due, and how long they would take. This way, I never missed a deadline, assignment or any other responsibility. In the end, I graduated with a GPA of 8.6, almost no student loans, and also interned as a data analyst during my last two semesters. There, I also learned a lot about workplace challenges, how to communicate with our team , I could also learn to manage and spearhead the biggest Tech fest event in college where up to 300 students showed up., Answer 3 (for 100% score), I got interested in coding since my first year. There was no student body or a coding club. I spearheaded the coding club and motivated many other students to become part of it. We started a culture of weekly coding contests and got attached to Github and Google coding communities. In fact, that really helped many students to build their coding skills. I would also conduct weekly classes to share my understanding and organize events with Alumni. Later we got sponsorship from college to establish an advanced lab for Machine Learning. Recently two startups are working from that lab and one of them, where I am a part of, received a national level award from TIE grad., Answer 4 (for 80% score), I am from a rural area where no one has even gone to a college university. I studied very hard on my own because there is, Search, ENG, IN, 10:42 PM, 11/16/2022, 68\u00b0F Haze",
